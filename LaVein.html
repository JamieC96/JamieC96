<h1>LaVein</h1>

<div class="columntext"> 
  <p>LaVein are a Metallic Hardcore band from Dublin Ireland. Born in January 2023, LaVein was formed after 3 members of Garsenda (Jamie, Conor and Lachlan) had a desire to create
    a project with more aggression and heavier than what they were previously working on. The band quickly recruited Peter Cooney and Rossa Molloy and started work on their debut EP "Fine Failure". Within months
  of forming, the band would go on to win Metal 2 the Masses Ireland, and be given a chance to play one of the largest metal festivals in the UK Bloodstock, alongside the likes of Megadeth, Killswitch
  Engage and Mesuggah. Since then, the band has released their Debut EP "Fine Failure", released a music video, toured Ireland and the UK alongside bands such as Chelsea Grin, Kublai Khan
  and Burner and is gearing up for an even bigger 2024 with their second EP on the horizon.</p>

  <p>In between touring and writing music, we worked with local Dublin based director Andrew Holohan to record the music video for one of our tracks, Crash the Gates. We filmed this video in the basement 
    of an office building in the liberties in Dublin. The music video is mostly perfromance based with shots from different areas of the basement. Using smoke machines and lights, we 
  managed to create a cool affect that also refelcted the vibe of the track. Please watch the music video to the left here!</p>
